7. Nico Actual configuration:
	1. UAVCAN_ENABLE = 2 [(Sensors Automatic Config)] (if you have have UAVCAN sensors but no motor controllers)(Specific to HereFlow Optical Flow Sensor)
	2. EKF2_AID_MASK = 2 [Cant be changed. Change following instead]:
		1. EKF2_GPS_CTRL = 0 [Before = 1]
		2. EKF2_OF_CTRL = 1 [Enable] 
		3. EKF2_IMU_CTRL = 7 [Before = 3] 
		4. EKF2_EV_CTRL = 0 [Enable] 
		5. EKF2_EV_CTRL = 0 [Enable] 
		6. EKF2_DRAG_CTRL = 0 [Enable] 
		7. EKF2_EV_CTRL = 0 [Enable] 
		8. EKF2_GPS_CTRL = 0 [Enable] 
		9. EKF2_EV_CTRL = 0 [Enable] 
	3. If optical flow offset from centre, use (position of optical flow focal point in body frame (default is 0.0m)): NOTE!!!: axis with origin relative to vehicle centre of gravity
		1. EKF2_OF_POS_X = 0
		2. EKF2_OF_POS_Y = 0
		3. EKF2_OF_POS_Z = 0
	4. EKF2_HGT_MODE = Range Sensor [Does not exist]
	5. EKF2_HGT_REF = Range Sensor [Before = Barometric Pressure]
	6. SENS_FLOW_MINHGT = 0 (Not necessary) [Does not exist]
	7. MAYBE_   CBRK_GPSFAIL: 240024 (ignoring GPS) [Does not exist]
	8. EKF2_RNG_CTRL = Enabled (conditional mode) 
	9. UAVCAN_SUB_FLOW = Enable
	10. UAVCAN_SUB_RNG= Enable
8. To test if Optical Flow Sensor and Lidar works:
	1. MAVLink Inspector, you should be able to see:
		1. DISTANCE_SENSOR
		2. OPTICAL_FLOW_RAD
9. EKF2 Outputs:
	1. Attitude output data is found in the [vehicle_attitude]message.
	2. Local position output data is found in the [vehicle_local_position] message.
	3. Global (WGS-84) output data is found in the [vehicle_global_position] message.
	4. Wind velocity output data is found in the [wind_estimate] message.
10. MAVLink Console checks:
	1. List all topics: ls /obj
	2. listener vehicle_local_position
	3. listener vehicle_attitude
	4. sensors status

# Position mode flight test
1. TEST 1(Home): moves a bit and then overcompensates
	1. Change EKF2_OF_POS_Z = 0.062m
	2. Did Level Horizon Sensor calibration
	3. Did Gyroscope Sensor calibration
2. TEST 2(Home): A bit better, but still overcompensates a bit and struggles a lot at low altitude
	1. Check out Position mode PID controls
	2. Maybe add a led at bottom, if too dark
	3. Recalibrate accelerometer
3. TEST 3(LAB): Test at lab, very good lighting. Drone behaved very weirdly and unpredictable
	1. Calibrated all sensors
4. TEST 4(LAB): Test went very well.
	1. Check message I sent to Callen
5. NOTE: TEST IN DARK ROOM WITH LED ATACHED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
6. NOTE: CHECK IF I CAN DO OPTICAL FLOW AND LIDAR SENSOR CALIBRATION

# Altitude control flight test

1. Test 1(LAB): Test went well
	1. See message I sent to callen
2. NOTE: TEST MAX ALTITUDE. DOES IT BECOME PROBLEM WHEN REACHING LIDAR MAX?!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!



# After moving Optical Flow to front, reconfiguration(29/11/2024):

1. TEST 1(LAB): moves a bit and then overcompensates
	1. Change: 
		1. EKF2_OF_POS_X = 0.020m(Changed)
		2. EKF2_OF_POS_Z = 0.062m
2. TEST 2: Can I disable magnetometer?
	1. SYS_HAS_MAG=0: (WAS1)
	2. EKF2_MAG_TYPE=NONE: (WAS Automatic)
	3. SYS_HAS_GPS= Disabled (Was Enabled)
		1. This looks a lot better. Drone does drift a bit to back left, when in aero mode, might be doe to imperfect/damaged prop on back left. 
		2. Quad also does not really rotate anymore in air. Might be due to 2 reasons:
			1. Magnetometer disturbances in lab and effect on ekf2
			2. Optical flow displaced backwards makes it easier to detect changes in rotation. think about the offset and the center point of rotation of the drone
	4. These good results lead to another positional/mapping test
