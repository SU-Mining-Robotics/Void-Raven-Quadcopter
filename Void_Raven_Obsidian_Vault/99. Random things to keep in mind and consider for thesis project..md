1. I'm designing for fast mapping, low computational cost and low financial cost
2. Aiding husky in underground exploration 
	1. If mine alone works very well, pivot to individual exploration, but lets see
	2. If mine alone performs worse than expected, maybe pivot into very short exploration missions for husky
3. If I'm designing for fast mapping and have short missions:
	1. Loop closure (highly dependent on feature detection)(Also very important/critical for reducing/eliminating sensor drift from sensors like IMU, etc. [Watch this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saVZtgPyyJQ&ab_channel=MATLAB)), might not be necessary, as there wont be much drift on short missions. Lets see!
