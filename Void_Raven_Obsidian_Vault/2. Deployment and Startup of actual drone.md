# To Start off and get the drone in the air (Testing of Hardware and communication between hardware):

ToDo:
- Download and install QGroundcontrol [here](http://qgroundcontrol.com/downloads/)

Note: 
- You must first [load firmware and select your vehicle frame/type](https://docs.px4.io/main/en/config/#firmware-vehicle-selection). Most other steps can be done out of order, except for [tuning](https://docs.px4.io/main/en/config/#tuning), which must be done last.
- A good walkthrough video for setup can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNzeVGD8IZI&ab_channel=AlexFache)

1. Use QGroundcontrol to flash PX4 firmware onto pixhawk with firmware according to [this page.](https://docs.px4.io/main/en/config/firmware.html) This is also used for updating firmware
2. Set the Airframe and do configurations according to [this page](https://docs.px4.io/main/en/config/airframe.html)
3. Perform [ Actuator Configuration and Testing](https://docs.px4.io/main/en/config/actuators.html)
	1. Geometry 
	2. Actuator Outputs
		1. Note: "PWM MAIN"  is I/O Board output and "PWM AUX" is FMU (Flight Management Unit) Board output ->From "Actuator Outputs" section
			1. PWM AUX outputs are preferred over the PWM MAIN outputs for controlling motors (they have lower latency).
		2. For ESC Protocols: Select DShot (Is digital protocol, find advantages [here](https://oscarliang.com/dshot/#Requirement-For-Flight-Controller))
		3. For DShot baud rate: Use DShot600 (Most widely used and lots of testing. See [Select the DShot baud rate](https://ardupilot.org/copter/docs/common-dshot-escs.html))
	3. Actuator Testing......................................................................
4. Sensor Setup: Calibrate all sensors
5. Radio Setup [here](https://docs.px4.io/v1.13/en/config/radio.html): 
	1. Calibrate Radio and follow prompts
6. Flight Modes [here](https://docs.px4.io/v1.13/en/config/flight_mode.html):
	1. Find explanation for different flight modes [here](https://docs.px4.io/main/en/flight_modes_mc/)
	2. For flight/hover test I chose:
		1. Altitude mode (No GPS required)
		2. Acro
		3. Land
	3. Add Arm Switch
	4. Add Emergency kill switch
7. Power/Battery Setup [here](https://docs.px4.io/v1.13/en/config/battery.html)
	1. Set number of battery cells
	2. Perform ESC calibration 
8. Safety Setup:
	1. RC Loss Failsafe Trigger: Land Mode or disarm????????????????????
		1. (I chose disarm for now) (Return is default)
9. 



10. Perform [Tuning](https://docs.px4.io/main/en/config/#tuning)
	1. At first test flight (10/06/2024_13:29):
		1. High level of oscillations during hovering
		2. Motors very hot after a very short flight, this should not be the case:
	2. For tuning stick to following order:
		1. Rate controller tuning (in acro, stabilized or altitude mode)
		2. Attitude controller tuning
		3. Velocity & Position Controller Tuning (position mode)
	3. Things to consider:
		The PID values can be adjusted as follows:
	    - P (proportional) or K gain:
	        - increase this for more responsiveness
	        - reduce if the response is overshooting and/or oscillating (up to a certain point increasing the D gain also helps).
	    - D (derivative) gain:
	        - this can be increased to dampen overshoots and oscillations
	        - increase this only as much as needed, as it amplifies noise (and can lead to hot motors)
	    - I (integral) gain:
	        - used to reduce steady-state error
	        - if too low, the response might never reach the setpoint (e.g. in wind)
	        - if too high, slow oscillations can occur
	4. At second test flight, PWM600 was used with other quadcopter config, flight still a bit weird and odd sound
	5. 4s battery was then tested (10/06/2024_15:13)
	6. 
	7. 
	8. 
	9. Therefore, for first tune do:
		- Decrease K from ___ to ___
		- Decrease D from ___ to ___
		- Leave I





After RBPi has been added, changed following settings:
1. For checking comms between RBPi and FC I chose:
	1. Flight modes:
		1. Altitude mode (No GPS required)
		2. Offboard
		3. Land
	2. Add Arm Switch
	3. Add Emergency kill switch


















# Later : Support new vehicle types and variants, modify flight algorithms, add new modes, integrate new hardware, and communicate with PX4 from outside the flight controller.
