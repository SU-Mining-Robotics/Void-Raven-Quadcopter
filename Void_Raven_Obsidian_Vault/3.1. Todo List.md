# This week








# General

1. OAK-D Stuff on RBPi ==TICK
2. Raspberry Pi Headless==TICK
3. Find Power LED for lighting==TICK
	1. RMF owl had 1000Lm



1. Rosbag record with OAK-D cam ==HALF TICK
2. Visualize the position obtained from quad EKF (Install PX4 on ubuntu PC first)==HALF TICK
3. Set up oak-d on vim==TICK
	1. Then setup px4 on vim==TICK
	2. Connect FC to VIM==TICK
4. Try setup realsense with vim4 again ==HALF TICK (Didnt Work)
5. Try write own python pipeline and script for oak-d depth cloud (look at [Python virtual environment](https://www.pythonguis.com/tutorials/python-virtual-environments/?gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQiArby5BhCDARIsAIJvjIRbIllTfdhCEEMJR4uLXX7DjHIxEJ2E8UbSVPzc1iFfwtRPMxo_vpcaAm7QEALw_wcB)) 
6. OAK-D Mount
7. RealSense vs OAK-D comparison
8. Why OAK-D didnt work in rosbag recording ==HALF TICK
	1. CPU overload, overheat=throttle
9. 
10. Code Mapping algorithm to transform pointcloud
	1. [ROS2 Gazebo World 2D/3D Map Generator](https://medium.com/@arshad.mehmood/ros2-gazebo-world-map-generator-a103b510a7e5) 
	2. [Navigation and 3D Mapping with ROS2](https://github.com/mich-pest/ros2_navigation_stvl?tab=readme-ov-file) 
	3. [Map To Odom Publisher](https://github.com/tim-fan/map_to_odom_publisher) 
11. Figure out how to create map frame and dynamic transform to robot
12. Explore mapping and path planning algorithms
13. Raspberry pi power cable
14. Raspberry Pi launch file for headless
	1. Can also consider loading ubuntu headless/server onto pi, as I dont need Realsense D435i working anymore
15. 




# DO next:

1. Setup px4 on vim==TICK
2. Visualize quad position from EKF2 ==TICK
	1. Extract points from topic and transfer to .txt file. ==TICK
	2. Plot in matlab or similar==TICK
	3. might also want to add orientation==TICK
	4. convert from px4 ned to normal fdr or whatever it is called
3. OAK-D Mount
4. OF Mount on VIM4
5. Create Transform for mapping and test on intel realsense data set
	1. figure out pointcloud topic
	2. record point cloud and position/orientation topic
	3. transform point cloud data according to position data
	4. save to .pcd file
	5. visualise pointcloud
6. Set up offboard_control
7. Set up launch file
